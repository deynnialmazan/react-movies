# React Movies

Hello! This is my React Movies App. A website that uses API's to show different
movies. You can select one movie and see more information about it.

This website uses:
- Axios to fetch movies
- Function components (pages) and hooks
- react-router-dom 
- Not found page for wrong URLs
- react-helmet to change the titles of each page
- A react form with validations
